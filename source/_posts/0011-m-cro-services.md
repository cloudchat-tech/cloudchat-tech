## Summary

Carl and Brandon delve into the fascinating world of microservices, starting
with a brief introduction and a comparison to macro-services like monolithic and
modular monolith architectures. We explored the evolution from monolithic
architectures to microservices, highlighting the advantages such as scalability,
agility, resilience, and technology diversity. We also discussed the granular
scalability of individual services, the independent development and deployment
of services, and the use of different technologies for each service.

However, we didn't shy away from the challenges, addressing the increased
complexity, operational overhead, and resource consumption associated with
managing distributed systems.
