# Knowing Your (Cloud) Tools

## Summary

In this episode, we delve into the world of "Cloud Tooling". We explore how
different cloud platforms take similar approaches to tooling, with a variety of
tools such as command-line interfaces (CLIs), RESTful APIs (and even gRPC), as
well as programming language-specific SDKs.

We discuss the spectrum of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and Command Line
Interfaces (CLIs), comparing portals, CLI, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
strategies. We also cover the differences between various Integrated Development
Environments (IDEs), and the trend of living in the terminal/shell to be
"leetcoderz".

The episode also touches on the increasing popularity of the shell among coders
and streamers, and the importance of achieving consistent experiences with
different shells.
