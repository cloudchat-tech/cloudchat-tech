# Dude, Where's My Server?

## Summary

Today, Carl and Brandon cover a comprehensive overview of serverless computing,
starting with its importance and benefits. We explain the serverless model,
highlighting the differences between serverless and traditional computing, and
addresses common misconceptions. The Big Three Cloud provider offerings are
covered, including Azure Functions, AWS Lambda, and Google Cloud Run. Each
service is explored, with real-world use cases, key features, and best practices
for building and deploying serverless functions.

We also delve into the challenges and considerations of serverless computing,
such as cold start latency, security concerns, and vendor lock-in. The
discussion concludes with predictions for the future of serverless computing,
including emerging trends, the rise of multi-cloud strategies, how AI may change
the game, and the increasing focus on security and compliance.
