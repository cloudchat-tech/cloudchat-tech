summary:
  A deep dive into the open-source journey of Brian Munzenmayer, discussing
  community engagement, project maintenance, and the future of open-source
  software.
guest:
  name: Brian Muenzenmeyer
  bio: Brian lives in Chanhassen, Minnesota but hails from Manitowoc, where it
    was always cooler by the lake and is now a fantastic ice-breaker at parties.
    He has four boys that keep him bald. He does a little of everything, and
    prefers it that way. Sometimes thatâ€™s called being a unicorn ðŸ¦„, duck ðŸ¦†, or
    a jack-of-all-trades ðŸ§°, but he likes to land on the Seussical-formâ€”Sneelock
    of the Circus ðŸŽª!


    With a career spanning many roles, from developer, UX team of one, product
    manager, analyst, and freelancer, Brian brings an experienced and broad
    approach to many disciplines. He and his wife Meganâ€™s small business keeps
    them exhausted and grounded in customer delivery, innovation, and
    warrantee-voiding laser maintenance. Heâ€™s been published in Smashing
    Magazine, CSS-Tricks, Shop Talk Show, and led workshops at Web Design Day
    and the Node.js Collaborator Summit. He maintains the Node.js website, and
    has organized consecutive Grace Hopper hackathons towards first
    contributions from attendees. Open source software threads into many aspects
    of his life, and has opened doors heâ€™d never thought imaginable. It can do
    that for you too. Much of this culminated in the writing of Approachable
    Open Source. Give it a read.


    When not writing or working within open source software, Brian lives out
    programming tropes of drinking coffee and woodworking. He enjoys soccer,
    playing games with his sons, especially X-Wing or Chess, and never turns
    down a milkshake. Him and Megan spend as much time outside as they can
    muster, often playing with their kids, deepening the pickleball rivalry on
    their makeshift court, chasing clouds, or digging up the yard.
