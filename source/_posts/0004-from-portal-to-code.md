# From Portal to Code

## Summary

Following the conversation on Deployment Stamps, Carl and Brandon dive into the
concepts of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and its applications in cloud
computing. The hosts discuss the benefits of using IaC, including version
control and transparency in infrastructure deployment, making it easier to
understand what has been built and why. They also highlight the importance of
governance, such as naming conventions, in IaC, as this can make it easier to
find resources later on. Carl and Brandon cover both first and third-party IaC
frameworks, as well as pros and cons of each.
