# Paying Forward the Postage

In this podcast episode, we discuss deployment stamps, which are patterns or
methods used to deploy applications consistently across different environments.
We cover various aspects of deployment stamps such as:

1. **What is a Deployment Stamp?**: We define what a deployment stamp is and why
   it's important for consistency in deployments.
2. **Deployment Stamps in Cloud-Native Architectures**: We discuss how
   deployment stamps are used in cloud-native architectures like PaaS Compute
   and CaaS services like Kubernetes, where services can be scaled dynamically
   based on demand.
3. **Multi-Tenancy and Deployment Stamps**: We explore how multi-tenancy comes
   into play with deployment stamps when managing multiple applications or
   clients within the same environment.
4. **Networking Components and Load Balancers**: We delve into the role of
   networking components and load balancers in deploying applications in the
   cloud versus traditional networking setups.

These are just a few highlights to the episode; join us over on

want to hear from you what our next topic should be!
