# Risky Bidness: Ripped from the Headlines

## Summary

In this episode, Carl and Brandon explored the recent CrowdStrike outage and the
lessons to take from the event as it relates to high availability, business
continuity, and disaster recovery (HA/BCDR) strategies in the cloud. The
incident underscored the need for redundancy, swift response, and well-defined
recovery procedures.

Surprisingly, we drew parallels to the banana crisis of the 1950s. The
monoculture of the Gros Michel banana left the industry vulnerable to Panama
disease. The lesson? Diversity in dependencies matters‚Äîwhether in tech or
agriculture.

Remember: HA/BCDR and diversity are key to resilience.
