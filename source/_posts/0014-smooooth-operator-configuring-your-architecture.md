## Summary

In this episode, Carl and Brandon dive deep into the world of configuration,
exploring various methods for system, app, and user-facing config. Starting with
hard-coded values and whether there is ever a time for hard-coding, weighing the
benefits and drawbacks. The conversation then shifts to configuration files,
including web.config, app.config, and various environment-specific files such as
`.env` files for backend and frontend uses.

Carl and Brandon also explore feature flags, databases, and SaaS options for
configuration, such as LaunchDarkly, and delve into DevOps patterns, including
pipeline sourcing and configuration services like AWS AppConfig and Azure App
Configuration. Finally, they cover secrets management with services like Azure
Key Vault and AWS Key Management Service.
