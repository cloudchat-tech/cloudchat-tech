# Control All the Things! üõ©Ô∏è

## Summary

In this episode, Carl and Brandon dive into the world of control planes,
starting with what they are and how they differ from other planes you may see in
your solutions and the providers they run on. They chat about the balance
between automation and manual operations, and share examples from popular cloud
services and technologies like Kubernetes, AWS, and Azure. Then, they explore
the key functions of a control plane, such as resource management, policy
enforcement, and tenant, security, monitoring, and configuration management.

Carl and Brandon also take a closer look at control planes in Kubernetes,
explaining the roles of components like the API server, etcd, controller
manager, and scheduler, and how they work together to manage clusters. Finally,
they discuss the challenges and benefits of deploying and managing control
planes across multiple cloud providers, and share best practices for keeping
things consistent in multi-cloud and hybrid environments.
